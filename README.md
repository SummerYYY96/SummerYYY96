### Hi there 👋   

### About me   
I am currently a Bioinformatics Programmer at NYU Lagone working on both clinical bioinformatics and various research projects on methylation data and HiC. Previously a Master student in the Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics program at the University of Michigan. My training included biochemistry, genetics, computer sciences, and statistics. 
Prior to grad school, I had my undergraduate training at UC Davis in biological sciences. I had internships in the Denish-Kumar lab and the Ronald lab, working on plants' innate immunity projects to gain hands-on wet lab experiences.

### ⚡ Fun fact   
I love outdoors, rock climbing and hiking (did half-dome cable, 20 miles round trip!). Casually exploring the world by collecting postcards and stamps all around the globe. Amateur naturalist.
