### Hi there 👋   

### About me   
I am currently a Bioinformatics Programmer at NYU Langone, working on both clinical bioinformatics and various research projects on methylation data and HiC. Previously a Master's student in the Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics program at the University of Michigan. My training included biochemistry, genetics, computer sciences, and statistics. 
Prior to grad school, I had my undergraduate training at UC Davis in biological sciences. I had internships working on plants' innate immunity projects to gain hands-on wet lab experiences.
