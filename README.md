### Hi there 👋   

### About me   
I am currently a Master student in the Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics program at the University of Michigan. My training included biochemistry, genetics, computer sciences, and statistics. 
Prior to grad school, I had my undergraduate training at UC Davis in biological sciences. I had internships in the Denish-Kumar lab and the Ronald lab, working on plants' innate immunity projects to gain hands-on wet lab experiences. 

### 🔭 I’m currently working on   
- RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq analysis with interests in finding Ewing Sarcoma signature    
- Development pipeline to quantify mature and premature mRNAs abundance from RNA-seq data    
- Interactive interface for MERFISH probe design and probe quality control   

### 🌱 I’m currently learning   
- Biomedical signal processing and machine learning in MATLAB  
- R Shiny web apps

### ⚡ Fun fact   
I love outdoors, rock climbing and hiking (did half-dome cable, 20 miles round trip!). Casually exploring the world by collecting postcards and stamps all around the globe. Amateur naturalist.
