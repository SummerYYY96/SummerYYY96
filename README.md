### Hi there 👋   

### About me   
I am currently a Master student in the Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics program at the University of Michigan. My training included biochemistry, genetics, computer sciences, and statistics. 
Prior to grad school, I had my undergraduate training at UC Davis in biological sciences. I had internships in the Denish-Kumar lab and the Ronald lab, working on plants' innate immunity projects to gain hands-on wet lab experiences. 

### 🔭 I’m currently working on   
- RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq analysis with interests in finding Ewing Sarcoma signature   

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
